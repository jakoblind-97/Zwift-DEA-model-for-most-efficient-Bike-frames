# Zwift-DEA-model-for-most-efficient-Bike-frames
Zwift DEA model for most efficient Bike frames. Analysis only for the lols.

Analysis to show the most efficient bike frames given 1 constant input (watts) with 2 outputs (time spend on incline and time spend on straight).

I went with the Canyon Aeroad because it looks cool :)
